## Hi there 👋
Welcome to our Master Branch!<br>
This is [neuralvelocityai.onrender.com](Neural Velocity)'s internal core where every piece of bits and pieces are made by us from scratch to flabergasting.<br>

## What do we program?<br>
In this website we have every single bit of program made by us with <b>Python, HTML and little bit of Javascript (for function scripts).</b><br>
<b>If you have access</b> to our repository, you will be able to view our Master Branch.<br>

## Rules and Regulations<br>
As other websites have rules and regulations, we do have some,<br>
&nbsp; 1. If any data of yours has been misplaced or stolen, contact us and we will check for clues.<br>
&nbsp; 2. No arguements should occur in the organization or any other repositories of our website.<br>
&nbsp; 3. Regular updates should be taken for the website.<br>
&nbsp; 4. If your API has been stolen, revoke or delete it immediately to stop hackers from using data of yours.<br>
&nbsp; 5. If hacking was found by an customer/client, please contact the admins immediately as they know the procedure taken and to stop further theft of data.<br>
&nbsp; 6. If hacking of more theft was done by a hacker, an admin should activate Procedure PANIC where all data is saved and protected.<br>
&nbsp; 7. Admins have more respect than any positions below them.<br>

## Procedure PANIC
As of 2025 we have noticed that even other websites are being hacked. So, to keep our customers' data safe, we implemented the Procedure PANIC where, when we activate, (saves and protects) your data.
To keep our procedure safe, we will not say where it saves and protects our clients data so that it doesn't go into the wrong hands, and what we can say is..., we will say no more...
